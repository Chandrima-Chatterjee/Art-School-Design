# Art-School-Design
This project is a UI/UX design for an Art School website, focusing on wireframes and prototypes for the Home and About pages. Designed in Adobe XD, the project showcases:

Home: A clean and inviting layout introducing the art school, highlighting key programs, upcoming events, and a call-to-action for enrollment.
About: A detailed page providing insights into the schoolâ€™s mission, history, faculty, and facilities.
The design emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and creativity, laying the foundation for a complete and functional user experience.
